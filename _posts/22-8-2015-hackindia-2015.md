I got to know about India's largest hackathon of this year [hackIndia 2015][1], at least was suppose to be that or claimed to be that. Though I was late but anyhow I managed to get all the tickets to be part of this event. I was super excited as it was going to be my first hackathon for which I was traveling and changing my city and state.

###Positive Points
It was a new experience to meet new people and work together in person, collaborate with them to form a team and build a product. I met to totally stranger teammates, we form a team and were only "all girls" team there, and people were noticing and appreciating it. We build an application [Solidarity of Sisters][2] which is aimed to help female who are subjected to any crime. This application led us to the final part, presentation round of hackathon. There were total 5 batches for this round and each batch have 15 teams. We managed to present our application and got positive feedbacks from judges.

###Negative points that gave Positive learning
Being one of those who stayed till end of the event, I learned "how not to things, the hard way". There was a bit of mis-management. There was a lesson to observe and learn at each and every step, what not to do while conducting such a large hackathon. Over all 800 people participated and many of them leave the event in between because of lack of proper management. I learned how to make arrangements for providing accommodation to let participants sleep at night and for food on time. Making a proper balance of capability of providing internet and accepting number of applications is necessary to take in account before anything else. No doubt with power comes huge responsibility. I realized and learned that if you are making huge claims than you should work enough hard to plan and execute them to meet those claims.

So I got less because I was expecting a lot. But I learned new things which I wasn't expecting. I realized my capabilities of building an application without inernet. And got many lessons to conduct a hackathon or any event in a better way. I am looking forward to move ahead and participate in more hackahtons to get more expected and unexpected learning.
