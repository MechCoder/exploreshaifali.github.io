Have successfully completed Outreachy [Internship][6] and pursuing [GSoC][7] internship its normal for people ask for advices to me, who are seeking to get into such programs. And for me its worth to share my experience with them. Rather than speaking same thing to each person separately and repeating same things again and again I decided to write a post for it.

###Search Advices on Google!
You want to get into any summer of code program([GSoC][3] [Outreachy][2], [RGSoC][5], [Day Light][4]) and seeking for advice, well that is why you are here and reading this blog. So the first thing that you should do is google efficiently for such advices, there are plenty of posts that you can find on different blogs, [Quora][1] etc. Just query "How to get into GSoC" or "Tips to get into GSoC". You will get enormous advices. They all provide loads of motivation, encouragement and suggestions, that will surely help you. Before reading further this post I would suggest to google first and read other posts because I am not repeating same stuff here but all that stuff is very important!

###I am not a good programmer/coder can I try?
Well, that is why you need internship, else why not job our own company. You are not expected to do hard core programming on each and every day of your coding period of internship . Rather such programs allow you to learn new things that project need and apply them, that could be new software or tools or programming methodologies or real world software development strategies. You will have your mentor(s) with you who will help you and guide you to become better coder/programmer/to solve unexpected issues and complete the project. They will help you in understanding different concepts and will allow you to grow at your own pace.

###Choosing project/organization
It is an peculiarly interesting as well as one of the immensely important task. 
Think of a situation that you have `n` different super cool companies that want to recruit students like you and you will decide for which you want to work, also each company have defined their different works that they want you to complete. What else you need man/girl? Just go through the list of all orgs' project ideas and find the one that is exciting for you. Isn't it interesting? Looking at different project ideas, starting a process in mind and thinking for their solutions, understanding the problem.

Now why it is important? Because you need to find a project in which you have keen interest. Yes, it is immensely important! You should choose a project for which you have deep passion. Else after sometime that project will become burden on you and you will no more enjoy working on it. So it is very important to find a project that looks interesting, exciting and amusing to you.

###Community matters a lot
This is true for me. In my first internship I got super cool community where along with technical knowledge and guidance I got loads of emotional support as well as a fun full environment. Where we talk with each other on IRC and chill out with technical discussions altogether. 
While in other few communities, I have seen few interns struggling to get their patch reviewed and get suggestions for obstacle they are suffering with.
Mentor is a single person or two or few more people, they do guide you well but its better to have a good community. I have always preferred to increase the width of source from where I am getting knowledge and talk to the members of community other than mentor. 
Keep remember 'The More Eyes, The Better!'.

###Writing Proposal:
Writing proposal for summer of code programs and putting solution in it is a great experience in itself. It deserve a separate post, I will write one soon and update the link here.

###One Secret :)
The only thing that you need to know is if you think getting into any of such program is difficult, than it will become difficult for you, even if it is not. And actually it is not. Yes, no doubt it is challenging, it is a bit tough but not so difficult that you cannot make it. If you yourself believe that it is difficult and you will not able to make it, than you will even not able to put enough efforts to get into it.
While on the other hand if you believe that yes I know it is challenging, tough but I deadly want it and I will make it, than no matter what, you will put efforts beyond your own limitations and beyond your own expectations and you will get it.  

So First thing, Forget the Fear of Failure!  
Second, If you deadly want it, you will put huge efforts in it and will make it possible!

Good Luck!
